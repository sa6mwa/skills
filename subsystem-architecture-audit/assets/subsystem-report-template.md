# <Subsystem>

## Purpose

<What this subsystem is responsible for, what it is not responsible for, and why it exists.>

## Architecture and Programmatic Details

### Entry Points

<Primary APIs, handlers, commands, or constructors.>

### Core Types and Interfaces

<Key structs/interfaces/modules and how they collaborate.>

### Control and Data Flow

<Normal path, edge/failure paths, retry/idempotency behavior, concurrency behavior.>

### Invariants and Error Handling

<Consistency guarantees, CAS/locking assumptions, error translation, rollback/recovery paths.>

### Test and Observability Coverage

<Existing unit/integration coverage and critical blind spots.>
